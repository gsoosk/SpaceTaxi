# Space Taxi
This repository contains an impelmentation of a Taxi Service application (like Uber) by following Object-Oriented and Clean Coding principles. 

It divided into three main phase:
* `Phase1`: Main design and implementation
* `Phase2`: Dividing Server and Client using socket programming
* `Phase3`: Implementation of GUI for both client and server side using Qt

## How to run 
In each phase `makefile` is provided for compiling codes. You should just run 
```bash
make
```
in the code repositories and then run the executable file with 
```bash
./<executable_file_name>
```
command.
